# Note: This command produces the warning "debconf: delaying package configuration, 
#   since apt-utils is not installed", which is related to the fact that we are 
#   installing packages non-interactively. We can safely ignore it.

#   preferable to mitigate confusion by silencing catkin's build status. One might
#   improve upon this hack in the future to allow true errors to be passed
#   through during the Docker container building process.
